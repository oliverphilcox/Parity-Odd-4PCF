# Parity-Odd-4PCF

Analysis pipeline for probing parity-violation with the 4-point correlation function of BOSS CMASS galaxies. This is described in detail in Philcox (in prep.), and makes use of the [encore](https://github.com/oliverphilcox/encore) NPCF algorithm described in [Philcox et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08722) and the Gaussian NPCF covariance matrices from Hou et al. (in prep.).

Note that the main analysis was performed blindly, *i.e.* the analysis pipeline and plotting routines were all created before the data was revealed. The associated notebook was run only once after unblinding, to create the output results.
